# Alpine Ansible Execution Environment

This repository provides an alternative to the official CentOS-based Ansible [Execution Environments](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/execution_environments.html). Being based on Alpine, it aims to be more lightweight and runs with a non-root user by default.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

This project provides container images for Ansible [Execution Environments](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/execution_environments.html) based on [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/). 

**Advantages compared to the official EEs built using [ansible-builder](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder)**:

- non-root user context
- simpler Containerfile
- small Container image
- easy to use without ansible-runner
- easy to tweak what pip packages and collections you want to include

## ‚úàÔ∏è Getting Started

```bash
ansible-navigator collections -m interactive # by default we use the stdout mode in the config
```

Generally make a hosts file to a remote host you already have ssh'd into and also setup an example playbook where you use the ping module. Run it with: `ansible-navigator run test-playbook.yml` and enjoy the output!

## üìñ Usage

See the [ansible-navigator.yml file](https://github.com/Macleykun/ansible-ee-alpine/blob/main/ansible-navigator.yml)! It's configured that you can use your own private keys from your host easily and not leave logging/artefacts behind.
